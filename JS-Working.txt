How JS works?
Is JS synchronous or Asynchronous?
Single threaded or multi-threaded?

Everything in JS happens inside an "Execution Context".
JS is synchronous single-threaded language.
JS can execute one command at time in a particular order. Goes to next line of execution when current line of code is executed.

What happens when you run JS code?

When we run a JS code - A Global Execution Contextis created.
Execution context is created in two phase:-
1.Memory creation phase
2.Code Execution phase

When a function is invoked inside the global execution context - A whole new execution context is created inside global execution context.

Call Stack - It maintains the order of execution of execution contexts (Manages the execution context).
Other names for Call Stack:
1.Execution Context Stack
2.Program Stack
3.Control Stack
4.Runtime Stack
5.Machine Stack

Whenever any JS code is executed - a global object is created(window) and Global execution context is created alongwith it this variable is also created. 
Anything which is not inside function - it is in global scope.

undefined in console - Memory alloted but called before intialization.
Not defined in console - Memory not alloted [Error]

JS is loosely typed language or weakly typed language.
It does not attaches its variable to any specific data type.
Means we put can string in a variable a or array in it.

Scope in JS:- A code space where you can access a specific variable or a function.

The scope is where a variable is available in the code. Each block of code creates scope and a lexical environment.

Scope chain - 
1.Way of finding the value in the hierarchy lexical environment.
2.Chain of lexical environment is known as scope chain. And it defines whether a variable or function present inside the scope or not.

Lexical environment:-
1.Lexical environment is created whenever a execution context is created.
2.Lexical Environment:- It is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent.
3.[Definition of Lexical Environment:- Every execution context has a reference to its outer environment, and that outer environment is called Lexical Environment.]
4.Lexical means in-hierarchy or sequence.

var is a functioned scope.

Let & Const:-
1.let & const declarations are hoisted but different than var keyword.
2.Temporal Dead zone is the time since when this let variable is hoisted and till the let variable is initialized with a value.
Time between both instances is known as temporal dead zone.
3.To avoid Temporal Dead zone:- Push all variable declarations and intialization to the top of the code.
4.let and const are block scoped.

Example:-
let a = 10;// We cannot access a by window.a because it is present in a different scope.
var b = 100;//// We can access b by window.b because it is present in window/Global scope/object.

let is more stict than var.
let cannot be re-declared like var keyword.
const need to be initialized while declaring.

Errors in JS:-
1.Whenever we try to access a variable in temporal dead zone, we get "Reference Error".
2.When any variable is not defined in the code and we try to access it, we get "Reference Error".
3.In case of "Syntax Error" - the code does not even run, it directly throws error.
4."TypeError":- Re-Assigning a value to a const variable. 

Block Scope in JS:- 
Block scope is also lexical scope.
Block => 
{
    //compound statement
    //We group multiple statements in a block if we have more line of code, where JS except one statement.
}

Block Scope:-
{
    //What all variables and functions we can access inside this block is known as "Block Scope".
}

{
    var a = 10; //var is hoisted in global scope.
    let b = 100; //let is hoisted in block scope.
    const c = 200; //const is hoisted in block scope.
    //Block scope is a separate memory space where block and const are stored.
}

Shadowing in JS:-
[Var]
var a = 100;
{
    var a = 10;
    console.log(a);//value of a is 10 [a=100 is shadowed by a=10] [Present in global scope]
}
console.log(a);//value of a is 10 [a=100 is shadowed by a=10] in global scope also, since all are pointing to same memory location.[Present in global scope]

[let]
let a = 100;
{
    let a = 10;
    console.log(a);//value of a is 10 [a=100 is shadowed by a=10] a is in block scope.
}
console.log(a);//value of a is 100. Here a is in another scope.[Not in global scope]

Whenever we declare and initialize a let and const variable in a (global space not inside {block}) it would be available or placed in a "script scope" and not in "global scope".
When defined inside block, it would be available inside block scope.

Shadowing behaves similar like block in function also.

Illegal Shadowing:- Shadowing a let or const variable with var.
let can be shadowed by let. same for const.
var can be shadowed by let or const.

Scope in normal function and in arrow function is same.

Closures Concept:- 
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 

1.A function which is bind together with its lexical environment.
2.Function along with its lexical scope forms closure.

Closure Example:-
function x() {
    let a = 8;
    function y() {
        console.log(a);
    }
    a = 100;
    return y;
}
let z = x();
z();
console.log(z);

Uses of closures:-
1.Module Design pattern
2.currying
3.Functions like once
4.memoize
5.maintaining state in async world
6.setTimeouts
7.Iterators
8.Data hiding & Encapsulation(Variable which we don't want to modified in other space of the code.)
9.and many more...

Disadvantages of closures:-
1.Over consumption of memories.
2.If not handle properly - Then problem of memory leaks will arise.

Garbage collector - Freeze up the un-utilized variables/memory.

Function Theory:-
Anonymous Function:- Function without name.
Ex.:-
function (){..}
//Anonymous Function are used as values.
//This function should be assigned to variable like Function Expression.

Function Statement:-
function a(){
    console.log("Siva");
}
//A simple function with name is known as function statement.

Function Expression:-
var b = function (){
    console.log("Siva");
}
//Function assigned to a variable is Function Expression.

->Difference between Function Statement and Function Expression is "Hoisting". When a() and b() is written before the functions then a will give an output. However, b will throw an error since in hoisting it will be undefined in "Memory creation phase".

Function Declaration:- Function Statement and Function Declaration are same.

Named Function Expression:-
Function Statement assigned to a variable.
Ex.:-
var a = function abc(){...}
a();//Will get output.
abc();//Will throw an error.

Difference between Parameter and Arguments:-
var a = function (param1, param2){...}
a(arg1, arg2);


What are First class function/First Class Citizens?
A Function passed as an argument to another function is known as First Class Function.
The ability to use Functions as an value is known as First Class Function.
Function can be passed as an argument.
We can return a function from an Anonymous Function.

What is Callback Function?
A function passed to other function as a parameter.

Use Async for operations which take more time, So that it won't block the main thread/Call Stack.

Event Loop:-
