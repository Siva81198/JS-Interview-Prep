How JS works?
Is JS synchronous or Asynchronous?
Single threaded or multi-threaded?

Everything in JS happens inside an "Execution Context".
JS is synchronous single-threaded language.
JS can execute one command at time in a particular order. Goes to next line of execution when current line of code is executed.

What happens when you run JS code?

When we run a JS code - A Global Execution Contextis created.
Execution context is created in two phase:-
1.Memory creation phase
2.Code Execution phase

When a function is invoked inside the global execution context - A whole new execution context is created inside global execution context.

Call Stack - It maintains the order of execution of execution contexts (Manages the execution context).
Other names for Call Stack:
1.Execution Context Stack
2.Program Stack
3.Control Stack
4.Runtime Stack
5.Machine Stack

JS is loosely typed language or weakly typed language.
It does not attaches its variable to any specific data type.
Means we put can string in a variable a or array in it.

Scope in JS:- A code space where you can access a specific variable or a function.

Lexical Environment:- It is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent.
Lexical means in-hierarchy or sequence.
Scope chain - Way of finding the value in the hierarchy lexical environment.
